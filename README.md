# plushie

Build native desktop apps in Ruby. **[Pre-1.0](#status)**

Write your entire application in Ruby (state, events, UI) and get
native windows on Linux, macOS, and Windows. Available on
[RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/plushie) as `plushie`. The
[renderer](https://github.com/plushie-ui/plushie-rust) is built on
[Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) and ships as a precompiled
binary, no Rust toolchain required.

SDKs are also available for
[Elixir](https://github.com/plushie-ui/plushie-elixir),
[Gleam](https://github.com/plushie-ui/plushie-gleam),
[Python](https://github.com/plushie-ui/plushie-python), and
[TypeScript](https://github.com/plushie-ui/plushie-typescript).

## Quick start

```ruby
class Counter
  include Plushie::App

  Model = Plushie::Model.define(:count)

  def init(_opts) = Model.new(count: 0)

  def update(model, event)
    case event
    in Event::Widget[type: :click, id: "inc"]
      model.with(count: model.count + 1)
    in Event::Widget[type: :click, id: "dec"]
      model.with(count: model.count - 1)
    else
      model
    end
  end

  def view(model)
    window("main", title: "Counter") do
      column(padding: 16, spacing: 8) do
        text("count", "Count: #{model.count}")
        row(spacing: 8) do
          button("inc", "+")
          button("dec", "-")
        end
      end
    end
  end
end

Plushie.run(Counter)
```

Add plushie to your Gemfile and download the renderer:

```bash
# Gemfile
gem "plushie", "== 0.1.0"
```

```bash
bundle install
rake plushie:download   # download precompiled renderer binary
ruby lib/counter.rb
```

Requires Ruby 3.2+. The repo includes
[several other examples](examples/) you can try. For multi-file
projects (custom widgets, native Rust extensions, real project
scaffolding), see the
[plushie-demos](https://github.com/plushie-ui/plushie-demos/tree/main/ruby)
repo.

To add Plushie to your own project, see the
[getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md), or browse the
[docs](docs/) for all guides and references.

## How it works

Your Ruby application and the renderer run as two OS processes
that exchange messages. Think of it like talking to a database,
except the database is a GPU-accelerated GUI toolkit. The SDK builds
UI trees and handles events; the renderer draws native windows and
captures input.

The SDK diffs each new tree against the previous one and sends only
the changes. If the renderer crashes, Plushie restarts it and
re-syncs your state. If your code raises, the SDK reverts to the
last good state. Neither process can take the other down.

The same protocol works over a local pipe, an SSH connection, or
any bidirectional byte stream. Your code doesn't need to change.

## Features

- **Elm architecture** - init, update, view. State lives in Ruby,
  pure functions, predictable updates
- **Block DSL** - nested Ruby blocks build the widget tree with
  natural indentation, no templates or markup
- **Built-in widgets** - layout, input, display, and interactive
  widgets out of the box
- **Canvas** - shapes, paths, gradients, transforms, and
  interactive elements for custom 2D drawing
- **Themes** - dark, light, nord, catppuccin, tokyo night, and
  more, with custom palettes and per-widget style overrides
- **Animation** - renderer-side transitions, springs, and
  sequences with no wire traffic per frame
- **Multi-window** - declare windows in your view; the framework
  manages the rest
- **Platform effects** - native file dialogs, clipboard, OS
  notifications
- **Accessibility** - keyboard navigation, screen readers, and
  focus management via [AccessKit](https://accesskit.dev)
- **Custom widgets** - compose existing widgets in pure Ruby,
  draw on the canvas, or extend with native Rust
- **Hot reload** - `Plushie.run(MyApp, dev: true)` watches lib/
  and reloads on file changes with full state preservation
- **Remote rendering** - app on a server or embedded device,
  renderer on a display machine over SSH or any byte stream
- **Fault-tolerant** - renderer crashes auto-recover; app
  exceptions are caught and state reverted
- **Configuration system** - `Plushie.configure` for binary paths,
  extensions, test backends, and widget runtime config
- **WASM renderer** - `rake plushie:download[wasm]` for browser
  targets

## Testing and automation

Tests run through the real renderer binary, not mocks. Interact like
a user: click, type, find elements, assert on text. All backends
support concurrent test execution to keep your suite fast as it
grows. Three interchangeable backends:

- **Mock** - millisecond tests, no display server
- **Headless** - real rendering via
  [tiny-skia](https://github.com/linebender/tiny-skia), supports
  screenshots for pixel regression in CI
- **Windowed** - real windows with GPU rendering, platform effects,
  real input

```ruby
class CounterTest < Plushie::Test::Case
  app Counter

  def test_clicking_increment_updates_counter
    click("#inc")
    assert_text "#count", "Count: 1"
  end
end
```

The same interaction API is available outside Minitest via
`Plushie::Automation::Session`. Attach to any running app and drive
it programmatically. Agent-friendly by design.

## Status

Pre-1.0. The core works (built-in widgets, event system, themes,
multi-window, testing framework, accessibility) but the API is
still evolving. Pin to an exact version and read the
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) when upgrading.
